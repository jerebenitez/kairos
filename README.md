**Kairos** is a programmable, extensible CLI-first task and project manager focused on structure, automation, and personal optimization.

Unlike traditional to-do apps, Kairos will allow you to:
- Define tasks and projects with complex dependencies.
- Automate recurring logic with your own custom formulas.
- Track metadata (e.g. gym performance, hydration, etc).
- Transition seamlessly from a local CLI to a web-based SaaS.
